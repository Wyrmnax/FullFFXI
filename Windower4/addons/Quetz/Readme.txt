Just jotting down notes for dragon

--How to start your dragon--
//lua l azi|quetz|naga

//azi on
//quetz start
//naga start

--Set Hompoint to Quflim--
Sub /blm
Or carry warp cud

--Change your weaponset in the (dragon) lua--
Delete bottom code where it says windower.send_command('input //gs c Weapons Kaja;') and set it manually or 
just change the //gs c Weapons <putursethere>

--Changing Trust--
Requires you to go to data and go into settings.xml
Then go into the lua and change your trusts their too.

--Change your WS and TP set--
Same as above.

--Changing your Teleport Ring--
Same as Changing your trust

** THIS MATTERS **
I use a Dim. Ring for my Naga to Quetz... w.e ring you have change it in settings.xml!!

--Conclusion--

It's not perfect, but it gets the job done. I did not originally create this, I was given the dragon luas, and I altered them so it would travel to the next dragon in a loop.
